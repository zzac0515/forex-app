# Forex Coding Challenge â€“ Zac

This is a coding challenge from another company, it is a full-stack application that consists of:

Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Framer Motion
Backend: Express.js, MySQL2
Database: MySQL (with init script)
Dev Tools: Docker, Docker Compose
Testing: Jest

---

## Short Description:

This is a simple app that fetches forex rates based on dates and base currencies. 

I implemented Lazy Loading, so on initial load i will only display 12 data, scrolling down pulls the remaining data.

I have grid view and table view for my data, get more data by:
- Grid view: scrolling down
- Table view: clicking next arrow on the pagination section

Note: My init script has 20 currencies and data will only be shown for Today and Yesterday.

# Forex Coding Challenge â€“ Zac

This was a coding challenge from another company that I've interviewed for, after enhancing it a little i decided to include this in my portfolio.

It is a simple full-stack application that consists of:

Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Framer Motion

Backend: Express.js, MySQL2

Database: MySQL (with init script)

Dev Tools: Docker, Docker Compose

Testing: Jest

---

## Short Description:

This is a simple app that fetches forex rates based on dates and base currencies.

I implemented Lazy Loading, so on initial load i will only display 12 data, scrolling down pulls the remaining data.

I have grid view and table view for my data, get more data by:

- Grid view: scrolling down
- Table view: clicking next arrow on the pagination section

This app is responsive, it caters for both mobile and desktop view.

Note: My init script has 20 currencies and data will only be shown for Today and Yesterday.
